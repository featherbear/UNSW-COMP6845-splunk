## Introduction to Searching

_So Splunk is like a giant database, right?_  
_So therefore, to get information back, we need to make queries to the database, right?_  
_So if we need to make queries, there should be some sort of query language, right?_  
_Maybe something like SQL, right?_

Splunk uses its own query language called **Search Processing Language** (**SPL**) ([more info here](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/solution-guides/splunk-quick-reference-guide.pdf)).  
Apart from the basic search constructs of a query langage, SPL also supports chaining queries (i.e. piping), visualisation commands (i.e. graphing), and data massaging commands (i.e. renaming fields)

(For the future you, Splunk supports basic string searching on the entire log entry without needing to specify a field)

> This lab covers some of the basic SPL queries / keywords / syntax, but is not an extensive guide.  
> When in doubt, consult [@featherbear](https://featherbear.cc), or better yet - Google.

### The Search Interface

> Available here - [http://localhost:8000/en-US/app/search/search](http://localhost:8000/en-US/app/search/search)

![](images/splunk_search_interface.png)

* <Chip background="#ff7718">Orange</Chip> - Splunk query input field -  Enter the SPL query to run here
* <Chip background="#14ac40">Green</Chip> - Data tab - Different output formats of the query result
* <Chip background="#009ae6">Blue</Chip> - Field discovery - Information and statistics about specific fields
* <Chip background="#9f40a0">Purple</Chip> - Time range selection - Selects the time range for which logs should be included. Value can be set in the SPL query.
* <Chip background="#eb1a22">Red</Chip> - The <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Search/Changethesearchmode">search mode</a> that should be used. Use "Fast" at the expense of verbosity and debuggability.

### Which Index?

In large organisations there may be hundreds of indexes... How do we know what indexes are available, or which to use?

Generally, an index covers a specific purpose, such as: firewall events, load balancer alerts, office audit logs, Windows Event Log, etc... 

Try run the SPL below, it will return a table of the known `index` values (i.e. all the indexes)

> splunk> `index=* earliest=1 | table index | dedup index`

* `index=*` - Select all indexes
* `earliest=1` - Find entries with epoch time >=1 (basically everything)
* `|` - Pipe results to the next query
  * `table index` - Visualise a table containing the columns: `index`
* `|` - Pipe results to the next query
  * `dedup index` - Deduplicate entries with the same column values in `index`
