## Hunting

Let's have a look at our recently ingested (and field-extracted) logs!

As a reminder, here are the fields and values on each log entry of our `access.log` chunk (assuming you've been following the instructions)

```
index: websftp
sourcetype: my_own_log_type
host: webserver_or_something
```

> Try to write a query to pull all the entries from our `access.log` chunk!

* Remember, you don't need to use all three fields above!
* Also keep in mind to set the **time range** (or use the `earliest` keyword)

When looking through the logs, it isn't very effective to just mindlessly scroll through all the events, hoping that we find some anomaly or interesting event.  
We should try to be methodic in how we search!

In our case, it would be helpful to have some directive... How about searching for the activity of a device given the IP address `5.134.148.228`?

**Answer**

> splunk> `index=websftp src_ip=5.134.148.228`

**Follow-up questions**

* What was the device's user agent?
* What did the device try to access?
  * What was their HTTP response codes?
* Are there any other IP addresses with the same user agent?
  * What are their IP addresses, show unique addresses in a table

<!-- `index=websftp user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; CHM-U01 Build/HonorCHM-U01) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.109 Mobile Safari/537.36" | table src_ip | dedup src_ip` There are 18 IP addresses in total that share the same user agent -->
